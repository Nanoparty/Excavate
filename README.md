# Excavate

An exploration and resource collecting game about digging to the center of the Earth. Collect rare earth minerals and ores and exchange them for drill upgrades. How deep can you dig?

One of my first ever game projects. Made entirely in Java. Unfortunately the source code has been lost to time and all that remains is an executable jar file.
